# 🌐 Building my personal site with Astro

Is a PDF résumé enough in 2025?  
I decided it wasn’t. 🚀  

I always wanted to have my own space on the internet:  
a place that didn’t depend on social media, where I could share projects, reflections, and lessons learned.  

That’s how this site was born: minimal, fast, and with a design that feels like mine.

## ✨ Why a personal site

- Strengthens your **personal brand**.  
- Gives you **professional credibility** beyond LinkedIn.  
- The perfect hub to showcase projects, write posts, and centralize everything you do.  
- You’re not dependent on algorithms or changing platform rules.  

In short: your website is yours, always.

## 💡 How I built it

I won’t get too technical, but here’s the essence:  
- I used **Astro** because it’s fast and minimal.  
- **Tailwind** gave me a clean design without CSS headaches.  
- My posts are in **Markdown**, so I can focus on writing, not formatting.  
- The site is **bilingual**: Spanish and English.  
- I added a **dark mode** (because white screens aren’t always fun).  
- And yes, it has **Google Analytics 4** to understand where visitors come from.  

The fun part? Much of the structure was built with help from **AI (ChatGPT Codex)**.  
It was like having a co-pilot suggesting snippets and saving me hours of searching.

## 🔑 What I learned

1. Having a personal site is more than showing projects: it’s about **building your digital identity**.  
2. Today it’s easier than ever: with modern tools and a bit of AI, you can have it online in a day.  
3. What matters most is not the tech stack, but having the courage to start and publish.

## 📌 You can do it too

You don’t need to be an advanced programmer.  
If you’re curious and willing to share, you already have what it takes.  

There are templates, site generators, and even AI to help you with the code.  
The key is taking that first step: pick a name, create your space, and make it yours.

## 👉 Conclusion

Building this site was a mix of personal motivation and tech support.  
Now I have my own space, where I can write, experiment, and show who I am.  

What about you? Have you thought about what your personal site could look like? 🚀
